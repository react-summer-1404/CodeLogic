        "text": "Simple and short programs written to automate certain tasks are called scripts in programming. Unlike large and complex programs, they are usually written and executed quickly without needing compilation. Scripts are used in areas such as the web, operating systems, data processing, and automation."

        "title": "What is a Script Code?",
        "text": "A script code is a set of instructions written in scripting languages such as JavaScript, Python, Perl, or Bash, usually executed by an interpreter instead of a processor. These codes are used to automate tasks, create interactivity on web pages, process data, or control system operations."

      "section3": {
        "title": "Main Uses of Scripting",

        "title": "What is the Difference Between Programming Languages and Scripting Languages?",
        "text": "Programming languages like C or C++ are usually compiled, while scripting languages like JavaScript or Python are interpreted line by line. Scripting languages are better for rapid development and simple tasks, while compiled languages are used for large and performance-heavy applications."
